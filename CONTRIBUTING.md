Hey everyone ! Glad to see that you're interested to contribute in our project.

1. This project is an educational platform which targets children of class 5 and below. 
2. This basically renders the embed of YouTube videos on our web portal, which we'll find
according to our set syllabus.

3. What type of contributions are expected from the contributors?
 * Introduction to new features within the portal.
 * Ideas for syllabus and relative content.
 * If you're eager to display your content on the portal, please create a Pull Request with its 
 Youtube link. 
 * This portal is mainly made for the purpose of trying to do some social good for young students
 and to get aquainted with good WebDev practices, technologies and frameworks.
 
 4. For contributing, read  
[README.md](./README.md) and you can get a wonderful gist of our project.
